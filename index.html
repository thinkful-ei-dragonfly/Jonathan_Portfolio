    Hi, my name is Jonathan. I'm a fullstack developer!

  <section class="bio">
      <p>I am a web developer and current student of the Engineering Immersion bootcamp at Thinkful. My initial career ambition was to purue a career as an academic philosopher. I attended Tufts University and studied with some of the most well-respected philosophers in the world. I've always enjoyed analytical reasoning and argumentation, but I became disillusioned with philosophy's disinterest in concrete practical problems. I've found that coding has given me the best of both worlds. I'm able to work out my problem-solving skills and ponder abstract theoretical problems while also being grounded in the problems of the real world.</p>
      <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing strategy games like chess or poker, training in Muay Thai or Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and powerlifting. And on occasion, I'll read some analytic philosophy.</p>
